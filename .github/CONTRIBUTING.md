## Style Guidelines

### Git Commit Messages

We follow semantic commit messages:

| Prefix      | Description                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `feat:`     | New feature                           |
| `fix:`      | Bug fix                               |
| `docs:`     | Documentation changes                 |
| `style:`    | Code style changes (formatting, etc.) |
| `refactor:` | Code refactoring                      |
| `test:`     | Adding or updating tests              |
| `chore:`    | Maintenance tasks                     |

**Examples:**

```
feat: add air quality endpoint
fix: validate negative longitude values
docs: update installation instructions
style: format code with prettier
refactor: simplify validation logic
```

**Commit Message Rules:**

- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added")
- Keep first line under 72 characters
- Separate subject from body with blank line
- Use body to explain _what_ and _why_, not _how_

### Code Style

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Use meaningful variable and function names (camelCase)
- Write comments for complex logic only
- Keep functions small and focused
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Remove unused code and imports

## Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names with prefixes:

| Prefix      | Use Case         | Example                   |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| `feature/`  | New features     | `feature/air-quality`     |
| `fix/`      | Bug fixes        | `fix/coord-validation`    |
| `hotfix/`   | Urgent fixes     | `hotfix/security-patch`   |
| `docs/`     | Documentation    | `docs/api-guide`          |
| `refactor/` | Code refactoring | `refactor/cache-layer`    |
